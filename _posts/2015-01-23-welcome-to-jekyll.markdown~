If you have not heard of [Coursera][coursera], you missed a lot. Anyways there are two fantastic Algorithms courses on this site which has just begun. First one is [Algorithms: Design and Analysis, Part 1][stanford]  and the other one is [Algorithms, Part I][princeton]. First one is by Stanford University and the following one is by Princeton University. Although they have almost the same Curriculum, I am following both of them, because each one has its strengths and I am learning a lot. 
I highly recommend them, at least take a look.
